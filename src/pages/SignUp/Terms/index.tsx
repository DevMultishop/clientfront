        DAO — in English Decentralized Autonomous Organization — is an
        organization in which rules are defined in the blockchain system through
        smart contracts, allowing total transparency to all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, there is no central server (not even an entity OR EVEN A
        SPECIFIC OWNER) that oversees the processes — control is carried out by
        the stakeholders involved in the project. DAO's main objective is to
        finance the projects that are operated by these smart contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DAO will be voted annually by the community and will abide by strict
        compliance criteria. And the power of votes will be determined by the
        relevance of the players and members.

      <p>What is an NFT? WHAT DOES GAMEFI MEAN?</p>

        NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token”, being the translation:
        “Non-Fungible Token”. In short, it is a technology that guarantees the
        originality and exclusivity of an archive. In the case of NFT Games,
        there are games that have items, places, characters, cars, etc... With
        unique characteristics according to the proposal, where players acquire
        and trade these “NFTS”, generating revenue and profit from these
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>GameFi – OUR WORLD!!!!</p>
      <p>
        NFT Games also distribute rewards to users who dedicate their time to
        perform certain tasks according to the game's proposal. This combination
        of decentralized finance and NFTs with blockchain games portrays GAMEFI,
        a term that has been gaining more and more space, especially with games
